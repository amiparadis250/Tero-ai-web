# TERO AI

## Introduction
Globally, food waste is a major issue, with over 1.3 billion tons wasted annually, costing the economy nearly $1 trillion. Many people, especially in rural areas, struggle with food storage and handling due to a lack of accessible, practical knowledge. Existing AI solutions provide text-based instructions, which are often abstract and hard to follow.

TERO AI is an AI-powered system that generates step-by-step video demonstrations from text or voice prompts. It provides universal accessibility, helping users reduce waste, improve efficiency, and enhance economic outcomes.

## Project Objective
TERO AI aims to develop an advanced AI system capable of transforming natural language prompts—both written and spoken—into high-quality instructional videos. Initially targeting the agricultural sector, this system will help reduce food waste, improve resource utilization, and boost economic stability worldwide.

## Features
- **Prompt-to-Video Conversion**: Converts text-based queries into actionable video guides.
- **Voice-to-Video Functionality**: Allows users to speak their prompts for accessibility.
- **Multilingual and Dialect Support**: Ensures diverse linguistic backgrounds are supported.
- **Adaptive Content Refinement**: Learns from user feedback to improve video clarity and relevance.

## Real-World Impact
### Agriculture
- Reduces post-harvest losses by providing practical video guides for farmers.
- Enhances food storage knowledge, preventing wastage.

### Households
- Saves money by educating families on proper food storage and handling.
- Reduces food waste in urban homes.

## Technologies Used
- **AI & Machine Learning**
  - GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for realistic video generation.
  - Transformer models for natural language and speech understanding.
- **Huawei Cloud Solutions**
  - ModelArts for AI model training and deployment.
  - Cloud Storage for managing datasets and videos.
  - Ascend AI processors for real-time video generation.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Data Collection & Model Training
- Gather a diverse dataset of agricultural tasks and multilingual prompts.
- Train AI models using Huawei’s infrastructure.

### Phase 2: System Development & Testing
- Develop an intuitive interface for text and voice inputs.
- Conduct pilot tests to evaluate usability and effectiveness.

### Phase 3: Deployment & Scaling
- Deploy on Huawei Cloud for global accessibility.
- Expand applications to healthcare and education.

## Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria
### Inclusion Criteria
- Individuals and organizations involved in agriculture, food processing, storage, and drying.
- Video guides and tutorials for sustainable agricultural practices.

### Exclusion Criteria
- No support for preparing harmful substances.
- No engagement in unethical activities.

## Future Considerations
- Potential expansion into other sectors like healthcare and education.
- Continued adherence to ethical guidelines and transparent updates.

## Conclusion
TERO AI is an innovative AI-powered tool designed to tackle food waste and inefficiencies in food handling. By providing accessible, practical video guidance, it has the potential to save billions, reduce food insecurity, and empower underserved communities.
